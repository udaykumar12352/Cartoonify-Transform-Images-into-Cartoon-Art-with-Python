This project implements a Python-based application that converts real-life images into cartoon-like visuals using various computer vision techniques. The cartoonification process involves edge detection, color filtering, and smoothing to produce a visually appealing, stylized cartoon effect.

By leveraging OpenCV and other image processing libraries, this project offers a fun and creative way to turn your photos into artwork. It is beginner-friendly and showcases fundamental concepts in computer vision, including:

Image filtering and smoothing

Edge detection using adaptive thresholding

Color quantization

Combining edges and color layers for cartoon effects

This project is perfect for students, hobbyists, or anyone interested in image processing and computer vision.
